- "Best practices for SSH hardening?"

## ⏰ Automated Scanning

### Set up daily scans

```bash
# Schedule daily scan at 3:30 AM (adjust timezone as needed)
./scripts/setup-cron.sh

# Or manually add to crontab:
crontab -e
# Add: 30 3 * * * /path/to/scripts/security-scanner.sh >> ~/security-reports/cron.log 2>&1
```

## 📊 Example Output

```markdown
# AI Security Analysis Report
Generated: 2025-10-12 11:30:00 UTC

## Executive Summary

### CRITICAL ISSUES - Fix Immediately
1. SSH root login enabled - Disable PermitRootLogin in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2. Firewall not configured - Enable UFW: sudo ufw enable
3. World-writable files in /var/www - Run: find /var/www -perm -002 -exec chmod o-w {} \;

### HIGH PRIORITY - Fix within 24 hours
1. Outdated SSL/TLS protocols in Nginx
2. Password authentication enabled for SSH
3. Multiple failed login attempts from suspicious IPs

### Security Score: 6.5/10
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customize AI Behavior

Edit the model and parameters in any script:

```bash
# scripts/security-scanner.sh
MODEL="llama3.1:70b"          # Change model
TEMPERATURE=0.3               # Lower = more focused, Higher = more creative
```

### Adjust Scan Depth

Modify what gets scanned by editing the script sections:
- System info collection (lines ~40-80)
- Log analysis depth (lines ~180-200)
- File system scan paths (lines ~130-150)

## 🌍 Use Cases

- **Pre-deployment Security Checks** - Scan before production deployment
- **Compliance Audits** - Generate reports for compliance requirements
- **Incident Response** - Analyze logs during security incidents
- **Code Reviews** - Automated security review of pull requests
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Daily automated scans with alerts
- **Security Training** - Learn security best practices interactively
- **Threat Hunting** - Search for indicators of compromise

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **100% Local Execution** - All analysis happens on your server
- **No External Calls** - Zero data transmission to third parties
- **No Telemetry** - No usage tracking or analytics
- **Open Source** - Full transparency, audit the code yourself
- **Air-gap Compatible** - Works on isolated networks (after initial model download)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with smaller model** - Test with 8B model first, upgrade if needed
2. **Run during off-hours** - Schedule scans when server load is low
3. **Review reports regularly** - Set up weekly report review process
4. **Customize for your stack** - Edit scripts to focus on your specific technologies
5. **Combine with other tools** - Complement existing security tools, don't replace them

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Model not responding?
```bash
systemctl restart ollama
ollama ps  # Check what's running
```

### Out of memory?
```bash
ollama stop llama3.1:70b
ollama pull llama3.1:8b  # Use smaller model
```

### Slow performance?
- Lower model size (70b → 8b → 3b)
- Reduce scan frequency
- Limit concurrent scans
- Add more RAM if possible
